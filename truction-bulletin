[33m3c8635c[m[33m ([m[1;31morigin/master[m[33m)[m Implement browser network suspension recovery strategy - Replace fresh client approach with network wake-up technique - Bypass session validation when network is completely blocked - Add database connectivity test to fail fast if DB queries are stuck - Add automatic page refresh as nuclear option after all retries fail - Use simple HTTP request to wake up suspended browser network layer - This addresses root cause: browser completely blocking network after tab switch
[33m14a7898[m Add failsafe fresh client for corrupted auth state during tab switching - Race session check against 3s timeout to detect stuck auth client - Create fresh client as fallback when main client auth is corrupted - Use working client (main or fresh) for all database queries - Set session on fresh client for proper database authentication - This addresses the root cause: browser tab suspension corrupting Supabase auth client
